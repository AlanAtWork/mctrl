What is mCtrl
=============

mCtrl is C library providing set of additional user interface controls for
MS Windows, intended to be complementary to standard Win32API controls from
USER32.DLL and COMCTL32.DLL.

API of the library is designed to be similar to the Win32API. I.e. after window
class of particular control is registered with corresponding initialization
function, the control can be normally created with the Win32API's CreateWindow()
or CreateWindowEx() functions and controlled with SendMessage().


License
=======

mCtrl itself is covered with the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 or
(at your option) any later version. See file COPYING.lib for more info.

In brief, this generally means that:

   * Any program or library, even commercial, covered with any proprietary
     license, is allowed to link against the mCtrl's import libraries and
     distribute MCTRL.DLL along with the program.

   * You can modify MCTRL.DLL (or its source code) and distribute such modified
     MCTRL.DLL only if the modifications are also licensed under the terms of
     the LGPL 2.1 (or any later version); or under the terms of GPL 2 (or any
     later version).

Source code of all examples, i.e. contents of the directory 'examples' within
the source package (see below), are in public domain.


Getting mCtrl
=============

You can always get the latest version and most actual information on project
webpages:

    * http://mctrl.sourceforge.net
    * http://sourceforge.net/projects/mctrl

There are usually two packages for each release version available:

    * mCtrl-x.y.z-bin.zip ... pre-built binary package
    * mCtrl-x.y.z-src.zip ... source package

The pre-built package contains 32-bit as well as 64-bit binaries of MCTRL.DLL
and examples, and also documentation for application developers. The source
package is direct export of source tree from version control system repository.

The current code (possibly untested and unstable) can also be cloned from git
repository hoested on github:

Using mCtrl
===========

If you have the pre-built package, using mCtrl is as easy as using any other
DLL.

Header files are located in 'include\mCtrl' directory. You should instruct
your C/C++ compiler to search for header files in the 'include' directory and
use the 'mCtrl' in your preprocessor #include directives, e.g.:

    #include <mCtrl/version.h>

Import libraries are located under the 'lib' (32-bit libs) and 'lib64' (64-bit)
subdirectory:

    * libmCtrl.dll.a for gcc-based tool chains (e.g. mingw, mingw-w64)
    * mCtrl.lib for MSVC

And finally deploy your application with the MCTRL.DLL which is located
in the 'bin' (32-bit binaries) and 'bin64' (64-bit) subdirectories in
the prebuilt package.

Documentation for application developers is bundled within the pre-built
package, or you can also find the documentation online:

    http://mctrl.sourceforge.net/doc.php


Building mCtrl from Sources
===========================

Disclaimer: If you want to just use MCTRL.DLL you should probably stick with
the pre-built package.

CMake version 3.0.0 (or newer) is used to manage mCtrl builds. If you got
sources from git repository, you need to use CMake to generate native makefile
or project files and use them to build mCtrl.

Generating e.g. MSVC-2013 solution and project files, you can follow these
steps (either in CMD.EXE or in bash):
    > mkdir build
    > mkdir build/msvc-2013
    > cd build/msvc-2013
    > cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" ../..

Or to generate GNU Makefile in mingw-w64 + msys environment and build with it,
you may follow these commands:

    $ mkdir -p build/msys  &&  cd build/msys
    $ cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ../..
    $ make


Reporting Bugs
==============

If you encounter any bug, please be so kind and report it. Unheard bugs cannot
get fixed. You can submit bug reports here:
