[1] What is mCtrl
=================

mCtrl is a library providing set of user interface controls for Win32API.
Interface of the library is very similar to other controls of Win32API, 
including the standard and common controls (buttons, edit boxes, combo boxes 
etc.). 

mCtrl is covered with the GNU General Public License. See file COPYING 
for more info. 


[2] Getting mCtrl
=================

You can always get latest version, and most actual information on project 
homepage:

    http://mctrl.sourceforge.net
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mctrl

Source package, documentation as well as pre-built x86 and x86_64 binaries 
can be downloaded from there.


[3] Building mCtrl
==================

Note: If you want just to use mCtrl in your application, you might prefer to 
get prebuilt mCtrl binary from the project homepage, rather then building
it from the sources.

[3.1] Building with mingw
-------------------------

Note: With mingw project you can build only 32-bit binaries.

You will need gcc toolchain, Win32API headers and bash environment (e.g. msys)
and GNU make. You can download all of these from mingw project home on 
sourceforge:  
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

In bash, go into the mCtrl root directory and build the project with GNU make.
    $ cd /c/projects/mctrl-0.6.0
    $ make
    
[3.2] Building with mingw-w64
-----------------------------

You will need gcc toolchain (or perhaps two, if you want build 32bit and 64bit
binaries). You can download them from sourceforge:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/

Unlike mingw project, toolchains from mingw-w64 already contains all Win32API
headers and libraries.
    
Furthermore you need bash environment and GNU make (you can reuse msys and 
make from mingw project, get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

Then, before we start the building you may need to add bin directory of the 
gcc toolchain in your path:
    $ export PATH=/c/mingw-w64/bin/
(Assuming you unzipped the gcc toolchain to that path)

Then to build just use GNU make with proper prefix of the gcc toolchain:
    $ cd /c/projects/mctrl-0.6.0
    $ make PREFIX=i686-w64-mingw32-            # targeting 32 bits
    $ make PREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-          # targeting 64 bits

[3.3] Other toolchains
----------------------

You should be able to build mCtrl with any reasonable C toolchain or in 
an IDE (e.g. MS Visual Studio) with some effort, if you create a project file
or makefile or what the toolchain expects. Of course the primary target of 
the project shall be a DLL.

Just be sure that: 
 - The project contains all sources *.c and *.rc files under src/ subdirectory.
 - Predefine UNICODE=1, _UNICODE=1 for preprocessor.
 - The include path includes the include/ subdirectory and current directory.
 - Link with all required Win32 libraries (as of mCtrl 0.6.0 COMCTL32.LIB, 
   OLE32.LIB, OLEAUT32.LIB are required).
