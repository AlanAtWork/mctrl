What is mCtrl
=============

mCtrl is a library providing set of user interface controls for Win32API.
Interface of the library is very similar to other controls of Win32API, 
including the standard and common controls (buttons, edit boxes, combo boxes 
etc.). 

mCtrl is covered with the GNU General Public License. See file COPYING 
for more info. 


Getting mCtrl
=============

You can always get latest version, and most actual information on project 
homepage:

    http://mctrl.sourceforge.net
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mctrl

Source package, documentation as well as pre-built x86 and x86_64 binaries 
can be downloaded from there.


Building mCtrl
==============

Note: If you want just to use mCtrl in your application, you might prefer to 
get prebuilt mCtrl binary from the project homepage, rather then building
it from the sources.

mCtrl is primarily developed and built with mingw (32bit builds) and mingw-w64
(64bit builds). Building with other toolchains or IDEs like MS Visual Studio
should be probably possible with some effort: you just have to create the 
project file compatible with the IDE yourself.

In the steps below I assume mingw and msys are to be used for the building:

(1) Download and install mingw and msys. Any recent versions of mingw packages
    should be ok. You can download both from mingw project page on the
    sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

    If you want to build 64bit version as well, download and setup mingw-w64 
    too. You can get it here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
    Currently I use the prebilt toolchain based on gcc version 4.4.0
    mingw-w64_x86-64_mingw32_4.4.0-1.zip. 
    Unlike mingw, mingw-w64 has very poor documentation, so follow these steps
    to setup it:
    (M64-1) Download mingw-w64. 
    (M64-2) Unzip it into some directory, so that its path does not 
            contain any space. Do not place it directly into mingw 
            installation. I use C:\mingw64
    (M64-2) Add its bin directory into your PATH in msys. E.g. in ~/.profile,
            add this line in your favorite editor:
                export PATH=$PATH:/c/mingw64/bin

(2) Download and unzip the mCtrl source package somewhere on your disk.
    
(3) In bash (from the msys), navigate to the mCtrl project directory and just
    build it:
        $ make                                     # x86 release build
    or
        $ make DEBUG=1                             # x86 debug build
    or
        $ make PREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-          # x86_64 release build
    or 
        $ make PREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32- DEBUG=1  # x86_64 debug build
        
Note that if you change any source file (or add new one) under the src/ 
subdirectory, the Makefile will try to regenerate Makefile.dep as first step
of the building, to update source dependencies. 
If you do not modify the sources, that should not happen as the up-to-date
Makefile.dep is part of the mCtrl source package.
(This is because I am lazy so I like the stuff automated.)
